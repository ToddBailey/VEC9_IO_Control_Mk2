VEC9_AVR
========

Input / Output / Siren drivers for Secret Russian Vector Project VEC9

This directory contains the Xmega AVR code and wiring digrams for the serial-to-lights-controls-sirens converter
under the front panel of the VEC9 cabinet.

Most of the notes are in vec9_io.c

NOTE -- this is for the dedicated hardware built after the initial prototype.
That unit also uses an Xmega but has a lot of other hardware glommed on and this code will NOT work with it.
